            Did you know Harry Styles was in a band before he became part of One Direction? He was the lead singer in a group
            called
            <i>White Eskimo</i> with some of his friends, and actually landed first place in a Battle of Bands event the group had
            competed
            in a year before Styles made his first big on-screen appearance on The X Factor in 2010.

            The 16-year-old auditioned solo, with Stevie Wonder’s “Isn’t She Lovely” (1976). The audience cheered him on, and with
            2/3 judges welcoming him into the next round, he made it past the first cut. His luck ran short, however, as he was
            eliminated before he could make it to bootcamp and perform at the judges’ houses.
