        Did you know Harry Styles was in a band before he became part of One Direction? He was the lead singer in a group called
        <i>White Eskimo</i> with some of his friends, and actually landed first place in a Battle of Bands event the group had competed
        in a year before Styles made his first big on-screen appearance on The X Factor in 2010.
