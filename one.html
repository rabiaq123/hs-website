            Did you know Harry Styles was in a band before he became part of <i>One Direction</i>? He was the lead singer in a group
            called
            <i>White Eskimo</i> with some of his friends, and actually landed first place in a Battle of Bands event the group had
            competed
            in a year before Styles made his first big on-screen appearance on The X Factor in 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 16-year-old auditioned solo, with Stevie Wonder’s “Isn’t She Lovely” (1976). The audience cheered him on, and with
            2/3 judges welcoming him into the next round, he made it past the first cut. His luck ran short, however, as he was
            eliminated before he could make it to bootcamp and perform at the judges’ houses. This wasn’t the end of his journey 
            on The X Factor though...

    <h2> The Start of <i>One Direction</i> </h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Instead of eliminating Styles, judges Nicole Scherzinger and Simon
        Cowell decided to group him with four other male competitors at the time, all of which combined formed <i>One Direction</i>;
        soon-to-be the “world’s biggest boyband.” You might actually find it cool to know that Harry was the one who came up with the name!

    <h2> The Group's Success </h2>
    <div class="section">

            The five contestants worked together for the remainder of the competition and quickly rose to fame in Britain, holding
            third
            place in the finals. Shortly after, the group was signed to judge Cowell’s Syco music label.
          </p>
          <p>
            Styles was the group’s youngest member and a fan favourite. He had lead vocals in some of the group’s biggest hits
            from
            very early on in his career, namely: <i>What Makes You Beautiful</i>, <i>One Thing</i>, and <i>More Than This</i>, from their debut album
            <i>Up All Night</i> (2011). The album brought the group more recognition outside of the United Kingdom; it became a best
            seller
            in the United States the following year.

    <h2> Till the End </h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The best seller was followed by four consecutive albums released in the coming years: <i>Take Me Home</i> (2012),
        <i>Midnight Memories</i> (2013), <i>Four</i> (2014), and <i>Made in the A.M.</i> (2015). While the first three reached
        No. 1 on the Billboard 200,
        their final album just missed the mark at No. 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        All during this time, the group went on four world tours. Their first U.S. tour sold out within hours. Their final
        tour,
        <i>Where We Are</i> (2014), became the highest-grossing tour in 2014, the highest grossing tour by a vocal group in
        history, and the 15th highest-grossing
        concert tour of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a five-year long run with back-to-back album releases and concert tours, the band ultimately split in early 2016
        for an indefinite amount of time, following ex-band member Zayn Malik’s departure.
