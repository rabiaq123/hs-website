            Did you know Harry Styles was in a band before he became part of One Direction? He was the lead singer in a group
            called
            <i>White Eskimo</i> with some of his friends, and actually landed first place in a Battle of Bands event the group had
            competed
            in a year before Styles made his first big on-screen appearance on The X Factor in 2010.

            The 16-year-old auditioned solo, with Stevie Wonder’s “Isn’t She Lovely” (1976). The audience cheered him on, and with
            2/3 judges welcoming him into the next round, he made it past the first cut. His luck ran short, however, as he was
            eliminated before he could make it to bootcamp and perform at the judges’ houses.

        This wasn’t the end of his journey on The X Factor. Instead of eliminating Styles, judges Nicole Scherzinger and Simon
        Cowell decided to group him with four other male competitors at the time, all of which combined formed One Direction;
        soon-to-be the “world’s biggest boyband.”

            The music group worked together for the remainder of the competition and quickly rose to fame in Britain, holding
            third
            place in the finals. Shortly after, the group was signed to judge Cowell’s Syco music label.

            Styles was the group’s youngest member and a fan favourite. He had lead vocals in some of the group’s biggest hits
            from
            very early on in their career, namely: What Makes You Beautiful, One Thing, and More Than This, from their debut album
            Up All Night (2011). The album brought the group more recognition outside of the United Kingdom; it became a best
            seller
            in the United States the following year.

        The best seller was followed by four consecutive albums released in the coming years: Take Me Home (2012), Midnight
        Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015). While the first three reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200,
        their final album just missed the mark at No. 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        All during this time, the group went on four world tours – their final tour, Where We Are (2014), became the
        highest-grossing tour in 2014, the highest grossing tour by a vocal group in history, and the 15th highest-grossing
        concert tour of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a five-year long run with back-to-back album releases and concert tours, the band ultimately split in early 2016
        for an indefinite amount of time, following band member Zayn Malik’s departure.
