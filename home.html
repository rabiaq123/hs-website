        Harry Edward Styles is a British singer, songwriter, and actor. While his musical career began in 2010 as a solo
        contestant on the music competition series <i>The X Factor UK</i>, it took off once he was grouped with four other
        contestants,
        who together, would end up forming one of the biggest boy bands of the 21st century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of us now know Styles as a pop artist and former lead vocalist of <i>One Direction</i>, but those who never
        really had much of an interest in how the band formed or Styles’ solo career itself may not realize quite how unique
        the story behind this artist’s success is.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who grew up listening to quite a few of his songs (before and after he debuted as a solo artist), 
        I'm here to give you a deeper look into Styles’ life as an artist and how his sound changed with time.
