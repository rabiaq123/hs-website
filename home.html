      <p>
        Honey is a natural liquid sweetener bees make after collecting flower nectar. Over 300 types of honey are
        produced worldwide, each with distinct flavours, colours, and health benefits. While honey is categorized based
        on its flower source, the same kind of honey can still taste significantly different based on temperature and
        rainfall level. Even its colour is a telling point for its flavour: lighter-coloured honey is known to have a
        milder taste than its darker counterpart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its depth of flavour has made it a prized addition to many foods and recipes for centuries, and its composition
        has made it a viable source of nutrition for health improvement.

    <!-- OVERALL BENEFITS OF HONEY -->
    <div class="section" id="benefits" style="padding-top: 0%;">
      <h2> Traditional Benefits </h2>
      <p>
        Honey comes in raw and pasteurized forms. The latter is what we usually see in bear bottles at the grocery
        store… while pasteurizing honey can improve texture and colour, the heat used to kill undesirable yeast also
        tears down many of the beneficial nutrients within the honey. This is why, to retain said nutrients atleast,
        many prefer raw honey instead.
      </p>
      <!-- list of benefits -->
      <p>
        Most kinds actually share a core set of benefits! Here are a few:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b style="color: var(--header3)">Richness in nutrients.</b> While honey <i>is</i> mostly sugar, it contains
          small amounts of many vitamins such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and potassium... but no fat. It is rich in
          <i>polyphenols</i>; compounds found in plants that studies suggest boost digestive and brain health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style="color: var(--header3)">Antidiabetic effects.</b> It contains <i>adiponectin</i>, a hormone that
          helps regulate glucose and lipid levels which diabetic patients are known to have less of. The more of this
          hormone your body has, the greater the improvement in fasting blood sugar levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style="color: var(--header3)">Wound healing.</b> When applied directly to your skin, honey can actually
          help accelerate one’s recovery process after burns, wounds, and other skin conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b style="color: var(--header3)">Great for sore throats.</b> Many studies suggest consuming it may be one of
          the better methods of combatting sore throats and coughs.
        </li>
      </ul>

          <div class="honey-info">
            <p>
              Manuka honey is said to have a mildly sweet and nutty flavour that is followed by a lasting bitter
              aftertaste. It comes from the manuka shrub, which is a kind of tea tree native to New Zealand and
              Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although some may not love it for its flavour, it’s widely known for its health benefits. Manuka honey is
              rich in antibacterial properties. One of its primary antibacterial components is methylglyoxal (MGO),
              whose
              concentration level has a direct relationship with the intensity of the antibacterial effect. Honey makers
              evaluate the strength of the Manuka honey they collect using the Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) rating system.
              The UMF quality trademark observes the concentration of MGO and other primary compounds that should be
              found in genuine Manuka honey. A rating of UMF 10+ is required for the honey to be considered medically
              beneficial to the consumer. The higher the MGO concentration, the stronger the antibacterial effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manuka honey’s antibacterial properties make it the honey of choice for protection against bacteria and
              damaged tissue repair, as well as treating skincare conditions such as acne and eczema. From a medical
              standpoint, it’s known best for its effectiveness in minor wound and burn healing (it’s been an
              FDA-approved option to heal wounds since 2007!). While studies suggest it can also help treat digestive
              health issues such as stomach ulcers, there is a lack of evidence to back it up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manuka honey is commonly used as a spread on toast and bagels, but is enjoyed with yogurt as well.

              Canada-based Buckwheat honey has the strongest flavour and darkest colour of all honey varieties. This
              amber-coloured honey is generally described to have an earthy aroma and is said to be less sweet than the
              average honey. It’s made from the nectar bees collect from buckwheat flowers. Buckwheat’s richness in
              vitamins is what makes its honey so nourishing as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              All variants of this honey contain a high level of antioxidants… but what exactly does that mean? To start
              off, oxidants – or reactive oxygen species (ROS) – are reactive molecules produced in areas of your body
              in which other
              cellular molecules such as your DNA, lipids, and protein reside. The damage caused by the reaction between
              ROS and
              other cellular molecules can have serious health implications including, but not limited to, premature
              aging, heart
              disease, and cancer. Antioxidants help protect these macromolecules by preventing ROS from being able to
              attack them in
              the first place. While Manuka honey may be considered the healthier alternative from the wound healing
              standpoint,
              Buckwheat honey’s antioxidant properties trump those of Manuka honey. It has also been found to aid in
              reducing
              cholesterol levels and stopping DNA mutations that become the cause of illnesses including cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buckwheat honey is often paired with waffles, oatmeal, and smoothies, to name a few.

              Acacia honey, native to eastern and southeastern North America, is almost colourless and has a
              lightweight, sweet flavour, with a hint of vanilla. Not only is it loved for its taste, but its low
              sucrose content also makes it the preferred choice for diabetics, and its anti-inflammatory properties
              makes it a good treatment for respiratory disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Buckwheat honey, Acacia honey contains a large amount of plant compounds with antioxidant properties.
              Flavonoids are the primary type of antioxidants found in the composition of Acacia honey, and they have
              high
              antioxidant capacity. Their antioxidant activities are: (1) restraining ROS formation, fighting ROS
              present
              in the body, and protecting existing antioxidant defenses. Various studies suggest flavonoids’ regular
              consumption can protect against many infectious and degenerative diseases, including heart disease and
              cancers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most types of flavonoids are also known to have anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is an ordinary
              biological process that occurs after a tissue injury, infection, or chemical irritation. Normally, it is a
              rapid
              process that resolves itself spontaneously, but when the process takes a prolonged period of time, it can
              cause
              numerous chronic disorders. Chronic inflammation can lead to metabolic disorders (chronic kidney disease,
              type 2 diabetes), neurological disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease), and cancers, to name
              a few.
