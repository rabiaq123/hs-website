            Two years after the band's lengthy hiatus, Styles debuted as a solo artist. His first single, <i>Sign of the Times</i> (2017),
            caught the attention of <i>One Direction</i> fans (and not) alike.

          <p>
            Many say his music style could be described as a mix of classic rock, soft rock, folk, and pop, which is said to be an
            influence of some of his favourite artists of all time… the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Fleetwood Mac, to list a
            few.

            Two singles from Styles’ next album were released 2 years later, followed by his second album, <i>Fine Line</i> (2019).

            Styles was nominated for 3 Grammy awards the same year. The album broke U.S. sale records and landed him nominations for
            <i>British Male Solo Artist</i> and <i>British Album of The Year</i> at the 2020 BRIT Awards.

        Another two years later came the release of this third album, <i>Harry’s House</i> (2022) which broke numerous records across
        the world. In addition to having 2022’s fastest selling album in the UK, his lead single <i>As It Was</i> (2022) drove him
        toward holding the spot for the number one track and album simultaneously in multiple countries including the US, UK,
        Canada, Australia, and Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>As It Was</i> became the US’ top single and stayed there for 4 consecutive weeks. Three other songs from the album made it
        to top 10, and all 13 songs made it to top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 dated June 4 – just around two weeks after the
        album’s release.
      </p>

        Looking back at his time with <i>One Direction</i>, many interviews seem to show Styles being one of the few members of the
        now-split group that would be open to reuniting if the others wanted the same. While some of the other bandmates said they believed a reunion would happen 
        at some point, most no longer seem too sure about that possibility.
